<h3>Forrest Gump</h3>

<p>One of the clearest messages that can be taken from Forrest Gump is that it's important to appreciate life while living it. Gump's story shows that people never know what's going to happen in the future, and that also includes not knowing when someone's time will be up or if their life is ever going to be compromised.</p>
<h3>The Shawshank Redemption</h3>

<p>The Shawshank Redemption is not a true story, but a film based on Stephen King's novella. The movie greatly expanded on King's work, making changes to characters and the ending for a more satisfying experience.</p>
<h3>Saving Private Ryan</h3>
